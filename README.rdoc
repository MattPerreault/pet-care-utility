== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation
Need to use postgres for production
May need to install posgresql on your machine as it does not come with the gem  

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
Will want to talk to prof. if generating integration tests is alright using Minitest 
rather than RSpec

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* 


App layout is called pages
example route for dashboard: url/pages/dashboard 
root route should be login 


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
