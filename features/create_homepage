Feature: Create a homepage
As a pet utility app user
I want to create a new homepage
So I can create and save new pet profiles to my account

Scenario: The user doesn't have one or more pet profiles
When I am on the dashboard
Then I should see a button "My Pets"
When I click on My Pets 
Then I should be redirected to Create Pet Profile Page
When I create my pets profile
Then I should be redirected to the homepage
And I should see my pet profile icon

Then I should see a button "My Pets"
When I click on "My Pets"
Then I should be redirected to the homepage

Scenario: The user is on the homepage
